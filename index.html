<h1> Ford - The GT Family</h1> 
<<img src = “Ford.jpg” width = “600” height=“337.5”>
<p> The 2020 Shelby GT350- offers precision-tuned suspension and handling that’s perfect when your idea of fun is rather twisted. The upgraded MagneRide Damping System monitors and adjusts itself one thousand times per second. The entire car was designed, engineered and built so that the springs, sway bars and dampers work together as one finely tuned unit. We also added lightweight chassis components and, for 2020 pattern.
The Ford F-150 Raptor- It generates jaw-dropping horsepower and torque from its high-output 3.5L EcoBoost engine and 10-speed transmission. It rides on 3.0-inch Fox Racing SHOX™. And Raptor's class-exclusive available beadlock-capable wheels let you deflate for ultimate traction without letting go of the tires. It’s part truck, part rocket.
Ford GT- This is what cutting-edge innovation looks like. From its 3.5L EcoBoost technology to its ultra-efficient aerodynamics, the Ford GT is the culmination of everything great we do at Ford. It’s what led to our win at Le Mans. It’s the same passion for innovation that can be seen throughout our entire vehicle lineup. </p> <font size = "5">
